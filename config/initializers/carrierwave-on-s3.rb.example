# don't forget to set the storage to :s3 in your uploader, like the following:

#     class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
#       storage :s3
#     end

# Thatâ€™s it! You can still use the CarrierWave::Uploader#url method to return the url to the file on Amazon S3.
# Alternatively, and especially if your bucket is located in Europe, you can use the RightAWS library by setting the storage to :right_s3

#     class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
#       storage :right_s3
#     end

CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.s3_access_key_id = 'xxxxxx'
  config.s3_secret_access_key = 'xxxxxx'
  config.s3_bucket = 'name_of_bucket'
end
